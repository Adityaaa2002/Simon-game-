The Simon Game is a classic memory skill game where players must mimic an increasingly long sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game. Each round, a new color is added to the sequence, which the player must remember and repeat in the correct order. The game tests and improves memory retention and attention, with the challenge growing as the sequence lengthens. Making a mistake resets the game, prompting players to start over and try to reach a new high level.
